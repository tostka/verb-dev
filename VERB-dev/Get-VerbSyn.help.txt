NAME
    Get-VerbSynonymTDO
    
SYNOPSIS
    Get-VerbSynonymTDO.ps1 - The Get-VerbSynonymTDO advanced function returns the synonyms for a verb.
    
    
SYNTAX
    Get-VerbSynonymTDO [-Verb] <String[]> [-Key <String>] [-Approved] [-AllowMultiWord] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The Get-VerbSynonymTDO advanced function returns the synonyms for a verb, and indicates if they are approved verbs using Get-Verb. Additionally, if the verb is approved, it will 
    indicate the group. This advanced function relies on the thesaurus at altervista.org.
    
    Note: What it detects as 'Approved' will depend on the rev of Powershell run under (as it uses get-verb to detect ApprovedVerbs):
     - new verbs added to ps6 - Deploy(dp) & Build (bd) - will only detect if run under Ps6+
    
    This is a tweaked variant of Tommy Maynard's Get-TMVerbSynonym: I'd fork his source, if he had it _github/bitbucket; Unfortunately he only posts revs to PSGallery (which isn't a 
    git-able source revision system). So we "manually fork". 
    
    This leverages the http://thesaurus.altervista.org/thesaurus/ Thesaurus API to pull synonyms for the intput vert, and then cycles each against get-verb to qualify Approved status 
    on each option. 
    Benefit, over get-Verb is that it autoresolves your conceptual verb, against related approved verb options. 
    
    Automatically drops multi-word synonyms (unless -AllowMultiWords used), as they aren't permitted ApprovedVerbs in Powershell.

        REVISION
        * 8:23 AM 12/13/2024 add: Alias 'Get-VerbSyn'
        * 11:55 AM 12/10/2024 add: Alias to output (queried via my verb-dev\get-VerbAliasTDO()) add: pretest input Verb, for ApprovedVerb status and pre-echo it into the outputs ; add 
        -AllowMultiWord, otherwise, it now auto-skips multiword returned Synonyms ; 
            looked at adding theaurus.com support, by splicing over code from kpatnayakuni's get-synonym.ps1, but found it doesn't parse properly anymore (html revisions in 
        theaurus.com output) ; 
            replaced TMs key ('fkS0rTuZ62Duag0bYgwn') with my own (simply requires a google logon, to obtain a free key).
        * 4:24 PM 12/09/2024 added full pipeline support, and looping to handle multiple verbs; updated CBH, removed script wrapper & script registration block; 
            renamed Get-TMVerbSynonym -> Get-VerbSynonymTDO(), added to verb-dev (could treat as a text movule, verb-text, but it does ps-approved verb testing, which doesn't apply to 
        raw text.
        * 3:00 PM 7/20/2022 init
        * 06/09/2016 TM posted v1.4 cites: [1.3], 01/04/2017 [1.4] 
        TM's prior release notes below:
        Version 1.4
            - Changed -- to $null for properties that do not have a value.
            - Removed redundant Get-Verb execution, when checking if a synonym is approved (uses OutVariable and temporary variable).
            - Renamed $Approved to $ApprovedVerb due to introducing the Approved switch parameter.
            - Added Approved switch parameter to only return approved synonyms without Where-Object filtering.
            - Added hardcoded position parameter attribute to the Verb parameter.
            - Added verb supplied by user to output object; renamed Verb property used for synonym to Synonym. This creates a list by default; however, it will allow for the Verb 
        parameter taking multiple verbs... version 1.5 perhaps.
            - Rewrote help where necessary to indicate changes.
            - Added *another* If statement, to ensure an object isn't created if the Verb and Synonym are the same: Get synonyms won't return Get; Start synonyms won't return Start.    
         
        Version 1.3
            - Modified code to handle logic outside of the object creation time.
            - Added Group property: Indicates name of the verb's group when verb is approved.
            - Changed Approved string property of Yes and No, to $true and $false.
            - Rewrote help where necessary to indicate changes.
        Version 1.2
            - Skipped 1.1
            - Included my key for http://thesaurus.altervista.org. This keeps from needing to register for a key.
            - Decreased number of spaces in help. Other help changes due to not needing to register for a key.
            - As API key is included, modified code to

    WARNING: The word "Car" may not have any verb synonyms.

    used as a verb.
